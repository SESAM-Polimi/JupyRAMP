    "- **User**: Associates the appliance with a specific user class in the RAMP model.\n",

    "- **Time Fraction Random Variability**: Percentage of the total operational time that exhibits random variability, default is 0%.\n",
    "- **Functional Cycle**: Minimum continuous operating time once the appliance is turned on, measured in minutes, default is 1 minute.\n",
    "- **Fixed**: Indicates if all units of the appliance always switch on simultaneously ('yes') or independently ('no'), default is \"no\".\n",
    "- **Fixed Cycle**: Defines the number of operational cycles, where 0 indicates continuous operation. Non-zero values require specifying cycle windows (up to 3), default is 0.\n",
    "- **Occasional Use**: Percentage indicating how frequently the appliance is used, with 1.0 meaning daily use and lower values reflecting less frequent use, default is 1.\n",
    "- **Flat**: Whether the appliance is subject to any random variability ('no') or not ('yes'), applicable to devices like public lighting, default is \"no\".\n",
    "- **Thermal Power Variability**: Percentage variability in power usage due to factors like temperature changes, default is 0%.\n",
    "- **Preference Index**: A numerical index used to associate the appliance with user's daily preference patterns, must be equal to or less than the max value specified in user preferences, default is 0.\n",

    "### Understanding Time Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functioning time windows** represent specific periods during the day when an appliance is typically used. Each appliance may have one or more time windows associated with it, indicating when it is *randomly turned on and off*. For initializing time windows, we use the `.windows()` method associated with each appliance object. This method accepts **pairs of start and end times**, expressed in minutes from midnight. For example, a time window from 8 AM to 9 AM is represented as `[480, 540]`, since 8 AM is 480 minutes after midnight, and 9 AM is 540 minutes after midnight. In addition, users can specify also advanced settings such as percentage of variability and daily usage profiles as reported below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parameters related to functioning windows\n",
    "window_1 = w1 #array of start and ending time for window of use #1\n",
    "window_2 = w2 #array of start and ending time for window of use #2\n",
    "window_3 = w3 #array of start and ending time for window of use #3\n",
    "random_var_w = r_w #percentage of variability in the start and ending times of the windows\n",
    "daily_use = np.zeros(1440) #create an empty daily use profile\n",
    "daily_use[w1[0]:(w1[1])] = np.full(np.diff(w1),0.001) #fills the daily use profile with infinitesimal values that are just used to identify the functioning windows\n",
    "daily_use[w2[0]:(w2[1])] = np.full(np.diff(w2),0.001) #same as above for window2\n",
    "daily_use[w3[0]:(w3[1])] = np.full(np.diff(w3),0.001) #same as above for window3\n",
    "daily_use_masked = np.zeros_like(ma.masked_not_equal(self.daily_use,0.001)) #apply a python mask to the daily_use array to make only functioning windows 'visibile'\n",
    "random_var_1 = int(r_w*np.diff(w1)) #calculate the random variability of window1, i.e. the maximum range of time they can be enlarged or shortened\n",
    "random_var_2 = int(r_w*np.diff(w2)) #same as above\n",
    "random_var_3 = int(r_w*np.diff(w3)) #same as above\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond time windows, accurately modelling the operation of some particular appliances such as freezers requires understanding their specific **duty cycles**. A duty cycle represents the sequence of operation states an appliance goes through within its operational period. This concept is especially relevant for appliances that don't simply turn on and off but instead operate in a *more complex manner*, cycling through different power consumption levels. For defining specific duty cycles, we employ methods such as .specific_cycle_1(), .specific_cycle_2(), and .specific_cycle_3() within the appliance's class. These methods allow for a detailed representation of how an appliance operates over time, including variations in power usage. Here below all the parameters involved:\n",

    "P_12 = 150 # Power level during the second segment of the duty cycle\n",
    "t_12 = 10  # Duration of the second segment in minutes\n",
    "r_c1 = 5   # Percentage of variability in the duration of duty cycle segments\n",
