    "- **User**: Associates the appliance with a specific user class in the RAMP model.\n",
    "- **Number**: Indicates how many units of the appliance are present, defaulting to 1 if not specified.\n",
    "- **Power**: Represents the energy consumption rate of the appliance, either as a constant value or a variable series across days (e.g., average in Watts). Default is 0.\n",
    "- **Number of Windows**: Specifies the count of distinct time windows within which the appliance operates, default is 1.\n",
    "- **Functional Time**: Total operational time of the appliance per day, measured in minutes from 0 to 1440, default is 0.\n",
    "- **Time Fraction Random Variability**: Percentage of the total operational time that exhibits random variability, default is 0%.\n",
    "- **Functional Cycle**: Minimum continuous operating time once the appliance is turned on, measured in minutes, default is 1 minute.\n",
    "- **Fixed**: Indicates if all units of the appliance always switch on simultaneously ('yes') or independently ('no'), default is \"no\".\n",
    "- **Fixed Cycle**: Defines the number of operational cycles, where 0 indicates continuous operation. Non-zero values require specifying cycle windows (up to 3), default is 0.\n",
    "- **Occasional Use**: Percentage indicating how frequently the appliance is used, with 1.0 meaning daily use and lower values reflecting less frequent use, default is 1.\n",
    "- **Flat**: Whether the appliance is subject to any random variability ('no') or not ('yes'), applicable to devices like public lighting, default is \"no\".\n",
    "- **Thermal Power Variability**: Percentage variability in power usage due to factors like temperature changes, default is 0%.\n",
    "- **Preference Index**: A numerical index used to associate the appliance with user's daily preference patterns, must be equal to or less than the max value specified in user preferences, default is 0.\n",
    "- **Weekday/Weekend Type**: Specifies appliance use as weekdays (0), weekends (1), or both (2), default is 2.\n",

    "- Reflect the structure of your specific community by accurately representing each user group along with their appliances in the rows.\n",

    "### Daily Average Load Curve - Hourly Resolution\n",
    "This section visualizes the average hourly electricity demand across multiple days, with a focus on daily consumption patterns. The code aggregates minute-level load data into hourly averages and computes the average, maximum, and minimum loads for each hour. The resulting plot features a line graph of the average demand with a shaded area indicating the variability between the highest and lowest observed loads, providing a clear visual representation of peak and trough periods. This visualization is crucial for stakeholders in energy management and planning, as it helps identify critical times for load balancing and informs decisions on energy usage and cost-efficiency."
